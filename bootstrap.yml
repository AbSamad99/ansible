# To run this file: ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass playbook-name.yml
# Note: If you are planning to set the ansible remote user (The one used to do the configuration) as this new 'zero' user, then while running the next playbook you do not need to specify '--ask-become-pass' provided you set 'remote_user=zero' in ansible.cfg
